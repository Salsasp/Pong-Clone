# Pong-Clone
This was a silly little simple project I worked on for a freshman engineering course at the University of Oklahoma.

## How to Play
It plays the exact same as pong, except the player now has the ability to charge a projectile by repeatedly blocking the ball with their paddle. Press space bar to shoot the projectile. The first player to 3 points wins.
